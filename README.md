## Ride-Planning

# Introduction: 

This is a program to decide car rides. Given a set of unique passengers and drivers, this program will decide on the best way to assign 
passengers to a driver. This will be a great program to decide how car rides between small groups of friends can be arranged. 

# Function
Passengers will be identified by their name, contacts, gender, and group. Drivers will be identified by their name, contacts, groups, gender, and maximum occupancy (minus themselves). This program will prioritize groups, then gender while spreading out the load of passengers evenly. If passengers
are not given groups, sex will be the deciding factor. If neither is given, the program will evenly distribute passengers. If no driver fits a passenger's
requirements, they will be distributed to the next available driver.

Users will first input all of their drivers and passengers. The program will then decide on the assignment.
